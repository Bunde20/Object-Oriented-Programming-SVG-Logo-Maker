# SVG Logo Maker

## Client Needs:
- Create an application using node.js to create logos based on user input.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Using the command line, when the user enters npm start, the user is prompted for information.
    - After the npm start command is given, the user is prompted to enter 1-3 letters, color for the text, a shape, and a color for the shape.
- After the user has answered all the questions a .svg file is created.
    - When the file is created it is titled with the associated shape located in the examples folder. (Example: Circle.svg)
- When the shape.svg file is opened the user should be presented with their generated logo that is set to 300x200 pixels.
    - This was done by setting the dimensions for the image to 300x200 pixels for the user to save.
