# SVG Logo Maker

  ![github-license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Client Needs
Design an application using node.js to create logos based on user input.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Using the command line, when the user enters npm start, the user is prompted for information.
    - After the npm start command is given, the user is prompted to enter 1-3 letters, color for the text, a shape, and a color for the shape.
- After the user has answered all the questions an .svg file is updated in the examples folder with the most recent input.
    - When all of the prompts are answered by the user the file with the associated shape will be dynamically updated in the examples folder. (Example: Circle.svg)
- When the shape.svg file is opened the user should be presented with their generated logo that is set to 300x200 pixels.
    - This was done by setting the dimensions for the image to 300x200 pixels for the user to save.
